[&rarr; My Vita](/EtienneBurdet_CV.pdf)

I'm a 28 years old Phd. Student (soon a Dr. !) in urban engineering. My main research is focused on the relation between energy fluxes and urban morphology. I try to produce models for engineers, designers or anybody trying to build cities, rather than for external observers. I also work on various side-topics regardings urban morhpology, urban design/planning and urban climate.

Here is how I look in my natural habitat :

Beside research, I traded my living room for movie theaters, I hunt art exhibitions, dance and new circus performances in Paris, I'm a huge tea/wine/food/restaurants geek and a passionate snowboarder.
