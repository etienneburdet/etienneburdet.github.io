### Software Linup

* [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) : switching from Emacs, still using emacs for a few minor modes (mainly GNU-Octave).
* [**TeXmaker**](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index_fr.html) : mainly because it's cross platform and provides super easy access to multiple compile options, shortcuts etc. (I hope a nice Atom package shows up though).
* [**Freeplane**](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
* [**GNU-Octave**](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) : who needs Matlab ? Still mostly compatible with it.

### LateX
*Phd and Vita template on their waysâ€¦*
**Essential packages** : microtype (the nail in the coffin for word processors), 
I only use lualatex as of now

### Website
Barebone, without content. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) stock [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes) theme, with very few tweaks. Good for a lazy clone. Deploy script is obviously for github hosting.
