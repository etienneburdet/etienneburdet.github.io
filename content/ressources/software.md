* [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) : switching from Emacs, still using emacs for a few minor modes (mainly GNU-Octave).
* [**TeXmaker**](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index_fr.html) : mainly because it's cross platform and provides super easy access to multiple compile options, shortcuts etc. But I hope a nice Atom package shows up.
* [**Freeplane**](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) : simple and actively developped.
* [**GNU-Octave**](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) : who needs Matlab ? Still mostly compatible with it.
* [**CitySim**](http://citysim.epfl.ch/) : Has the very big advantage of being integrable into a multi-software workflow (Rhino, autoCAD for preprocessing, Octave for post-process etc.).
* **Rhino** : my CAD software of choice for designing urban blocks. No good OS alternative as far as I know.
* **Illustrator** : Maybe a bit overkill for simple workflows, pictograms and posters butâ€¦ we get used to comfort.
* **Mendeley** : classic.
