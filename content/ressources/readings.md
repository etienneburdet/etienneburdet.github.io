Whenever I talk with fellow researchers, I realized I end up giving them a list a pretty standard books, rather than the latest new fancy thing in my feeds. They are not my daily read, more the basics of my discipline. They should give you a good sense of where I'm from.

- Serge Salat : The big bad guy. I was in Serge's lab when he wrote this and he is kind of my mentor, so I have different view on this book. I'm not sure it's readable straight from start to finish and I don't necessarly endorse all views. But the amount of information in this book is just incredible.
- The Urban Housing Handbook : before anything, look at what has been done in the world. It especially contains essential figures on density.
- Street & Patterns : Once again a broad view, not super technical. Just make sure you have all those pictures in mind.
- Space Matrix : Are you sure you know you basic arithmetics of urban morpho ? Super simple, still essential for good problem setting.
- Computer Modeling For Sustainable Urban Design : everything urban energy modeling, state of the art (the few published things, doesn't really change the game).
- Théorie du Système Général - Théorie de la Modélisation (in french only sadly) : why are we even modeling ? What can I understand from a model of a complex system ? This book is my base on systemic, on complex systems and more broadly on why I'm not modeling like a physicist.

A few more articles : . And there you are
