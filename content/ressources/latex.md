### Useful packages you might have missed

* **microtype** : For the best typographic grey ever ! Default settings usually give significant improvement.
* **glossaries** : Very powerful tool, provided you use it from the begining. Requires xindy.
* **lineno** :  For proofreading versions.
* **cleveref** : Really, really more clever than your usual \label \ref.
* **flafter** : I find it distracting when a float comes before it is actually refered to.
* **lmodern** : Defaut font enhancement.
* **fontspec** : If you need more fonts, you can just use any .otf .ttf.
* **tikz** : For awesome graphics. I don't really use it by itself, rather in workflows implying it.
* **siuntix** : Because units are boring to type.
* **booktabs** : Beautiful tables (kill those vertical rules in tables !).

### Tips and Tricks
