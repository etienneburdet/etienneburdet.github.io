### Templates
- [My Vita](https://github.com/etienneburdet/Deedy-Resume), mostly Deedy's, but ships with an opensource font and fontawesome icons for social links. Don't forget to change **all** the content !
- [My Phd. memoir](/stilltocome).

### Useful packages you might have missed

* **microtype** : For the best typographic grey ever ! Default settings usually give significant improvement.
* **glossaries** : Very powerful tool to create all kinds of. Don't forget to use it from very begining !
* **lineno** :  Double spacing and line numbers for proofreading versions.
* **cleveref** : Really, really more clever than your usual \label \ref.
* **flafter** : I find it distracting when a float comes before it is actually refered to. So fl(oat)after.
* **lmodern** : Defaut font enhancement. I find it better than any TeX Gyre.
* **fontspec** : If you need more fonts, you can just use any .otf .ttf.
* **tikz** : For awesome graphics. I don't really use it by itself, rather in workflows implying it.
* **siuntix** : Because units are boring to type.
* **booktabs** : Beautiful tables: kill those vertical rules in tables !
