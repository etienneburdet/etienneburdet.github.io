      <description>&lt;p&gt;The article on the thermal part of my model has been reviewed quite quickly. I updated the version with some minors modifications, you can find it on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/view/index/docid/1082955&#34;&gt;HAL profile&lt;/a&gt;. Hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful, feel free to ask any question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was maybe to understand how to properly submit a LaTeX article through EES. It&amp;rsquo;s well made in fact, you upload your .tex and .bib as manuscript and the figures as figures and the article is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;rsquo;s not said anywhere you should proceed this way. Actually the FAQ tells you to upload the .pdf as manuscript and the latex files as latex source files, while the dialog box orders you to never ever upload a .pdf (but still let you do it). How much are we paying for Elsevier again ?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Here Hugo</title>

&lt;p&gt;Whether for a personal page or a project site, we need websites all the time, to be someone on the web. We want something simple, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the money to hire a pro (when we should) – but hey, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard. So what do we have ? A &lt;em&gt;tumblr&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/em&gt; ? Hosting your own &lt;em&gt;wordpress&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;drupal&lt;/em&gt; ? &lt;em&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/em&gt; tools ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this web site, I chose a static generator: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Why ? You Input text files, it outputs a full – super lightweight and responsive – plain html site. Magic happens in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Be cool, be static&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those hipsterish days, old is the new cool and apparently we are back to static sites. Or static generator to be more precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does the thing works ? First I installed Hugo (it takes about 2 clicks) and told him &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;new site please&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. He gave me a backbone, empty site. Now when I want to input a new page, or a new blog post, I write the content in a text file using &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; and… that&amp;rsquo;s about it. Then you say &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;hey Hugo, make a site out of this bunch of text files&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and he generates a whole site in milliseconds. A fully static, ready to upload website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That simple ? That simple. You can customize the template, by digging a bit into the HTML/CSS/Go template. It is hackable to the core. The really great thing being the learning curve. Simple things — such as the social button — are simple to do and from there you can gradually tweak your site more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Ligh, flexible and free&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First advantage: no database. No php, no CMS, no accounts, no nothing server side. Read: no bugs. Just plain html pages that you upload on any host. No account on a specific service either (like wordpress.com), which means no adds, no terms of use, no limitations of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second advantage is in the long run. What will &lt;em&gt;tumblr&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;about.me&lt;/em&gt; be in 10 years ? What is gonna happen when I need to transfer my site from &lt;em&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/em&gt; to the new cool thing ? One thing is sure, plain html is gonna be here for a long time. This site is hosted on github, but if I want it on dropbox or any other host, I upload the file there and it is up in minutes, literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Mobile first, content first&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go for the superb &lt;a href=&#34;http://andhyde.com/&#34;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; theme. It is responsive (try resize that window) and it&amp;rsquo;s mobile first/content first. It means you don&amp;rsquo;t have one hundred links on the sidebar, you don&amp;rsquo;t have the avatar of every single guy who likes the page on the facebook, no wordcloud, no widgets everywhere, etc. Deliver the content efficiently, else it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be unreadable on a small smartphone screen. And it looks so clean on big one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light, fast, responsive, content first, customizable… I feel so free ! Going back to a CMS from Hugo for this kind of site would just feel like riding a limo on bike path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Site Opening</title>
      <link>http://etienneburdet.github.io/2014/10/open/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do this for far too long, here it is: I have my own website !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to expect here ? First the usual hub: vita, publications, social links. Nothings you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find on my lab&amp;rsquo;s site or linkedin, but this can&amp;rsquo;t be in too many places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a personal site should be, well, a bit more personal. So I listed here some resources on how I work, diverse templates, tips and a few readings. The kind of things I would tell you if we were to meet in person, but you would never ask by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I always wanted to have some sort of irregular blog on both city science and working in the academia. Half scientific things that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit journals, comments on articles, discussion on research itself (read: surviving a PhD), productivity at work, etc. I want to write on all those topics and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the ideal place to so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this site last in the long run, survives institutions and lab changes. I hope it gives you some useful infos and – who knows – maybe some fun. Enjoy your visit and feel free to share your feelings on this site !&lt;/p&gt;
