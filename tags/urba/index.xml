      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I talk with fellow researchers, I realized I end up giving them a list a pretty standard books, rather than the latest new fancy thing in my feeds. They are not my daily read, more the basics of my discipline. They should give you a good sense of where I&amp;rsquo;m from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serge Salat : The big bad guy. I was in Serge&amp;rsquo;s lab when he wrote this and he is kind of my mentor, so I have different view on this book. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s readable straight from start to finish and I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarly endorse all views. But the amount of information in this book is just incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Urban Housing Handbook : before anything, look at what has been done in the world. It especially contains essential figures on density.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street &amp;amp; Patterns : Once again a broad view, not super technical. Just make sure you have all those pictures in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Matrix : Are you sure you know you basic arithmetics of urban morpho ? Super simple, still essential for good problem setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Modeling For Sustainable Urban Design : everything urban energy modeling, state of the art (the few published things, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change the game).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Théorie du Système Général - Théorie de la Modélisation (in french only sadly) : why are we even modeling ? What can I understand from a model of a complex system ? This book is my base on systemic, on complex systems and more broadly on why I&amp;rsquo;m not modeling like a physicist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more articles : . And there you are&lt;/p&gt;
