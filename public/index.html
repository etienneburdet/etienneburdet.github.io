        What does a smartcity officer do ?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 15, 2016</span>

    <p>A quick site update to reflect my new position as a smart-city officer at <a href="www.arepgroup.com">AREP</a>. Which leads to  a natural question:What does a smart-city officer do, beside having a job with a really cool job name ?</p>

<p>First you have the top-down approach to my work.  Here, somebody (a stakeholder, a politic) comes to us and say  <em>&ldquo;Hey, I heard smart-cities are cool. I want mine. You make it?</em>. Sure we do but… is he speaking participatory urban planning or driverless cars  or smartgrids ? Or all of them ? Does even know ? So here my job is to decypher the notion. I have to understand what people want in a particular case—even though they are using the same question for asking very different things— and find out what we can offer as a solution with the many talents we have in the company. (And we have basically every kind of architects, designers and engineers you can think of.)</p>

<p>Then you have the bottom-up approach to my work. With the help of different experts, I test connected technologies and try to make a new project with it or input it into a new project. For exemple it can be a smartphone app for crowdsourcing informations in a GIS or testing a new energy storage device. Here, it&rsquo;s all trial and errors. I find something that looks cool, we try it for real, we learn. The most important thing is to the put the new technology to the test as fast as possible, without too much theory about it —especially on <em>&ldquo;is it true smart&rdquo;</em> side. That last part being way easier said than done.</p>

<p>The two approach are helping each other. Decyphering a smart-city vision may lead to try a new technologies and mastering a new tool may help to be more tangible about what we mean by smart-city. Hopefully, in the middle, we find some sort of strategic positioning, real projects and a way to value the expertise of all our architects, planners, designers and engineers. That&rsquo;s the plan !</p>

<p>There is one fun thing you might notice. In the top-down approach, it&rsquo;s not me to define smart-city, nor to debate what a smart-city should be. And in the bottom-up approach, we don&rsquo;t even want to think about it. So if I succeed in my job, well the very word smart-city will disappear from our practice and the sooner the better. But then my job title will sound way less cool…</p>

        Article Update
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 14, 2014</span>

    <p>The article on the thermal part of my model has been reviewed quite quickly. I updated the version with some minors modifications, you can find it on my <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/view/index/docid/1082955">HAL profile</a> (moderation pending) and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4956">arXiv</a>. I hope it&rsquo;s useful, feel free to ask any question.</p>

<p>The hardest part was maybe to understand how to properly submit a LaTeX article through EES. It&rsquo;s well made in fact, you upload your .tex and .bib as manuscript and the figures as figures and the article is generated.</p>

<p>Except it&rsquo;s not said anywhere you should proceed this way. Actually the FAQ tells you to upload the .pdf as manuscript and the latex files as latex source files, while the dialog box orders you to never ever upload a .pdf (but still let you do it). How much are we paying for Elsevier again ?</p>

        Here Hugo
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Nov 2, 2014</span>

    <p>Whether for a personal page or a project site, we need websites all the time, to be someone on the web. We want something simple, but we don&rsquo;t necessarily have the money to hire a pro (when we should) – but hey, this shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. So what do we have ? A tumblr, wordpress.com ? Hosting your own wordpress or drupal ? WYSIWYG tools ?</p>

<p>For this web site, I chose a static generator: <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Why ? You Input text files, it outputs a full – super lightweight and responsive – plain html site. Magic happens in the middle.
Be cool, be static</p>

<p>In those hipsterish days, old is the new cool and apparently we are back to static sites. Or static generator to be more precise.</p>

<p>So how does the thing works ? First I installed Hugo (it takes about 2 clicks) and told him <em>“new site please”</em>. He gave me an empty site that I used as a backbone. Now when I want to input a new page, or a new blog post, I write the content in a text file using markdown and… that&rsquo;s about it. Then you say <em>“hey Hugo, make a site out of this bunch of text files”</em> and he generates a whole site in milliseconds. A fully static, ready to upload website.</p>

<p>That simple ? That simple. You can customize the template, by digging a bit into the HTML/CSS/Go template. It is hackable to the core. The really great thing being the learning curve. Simple things — such as the social button — are simple to do and from there you can gradually tweak your site more and more.</p>

<p>First advantage: no database. No php, no CMS, no accounts, no nothing server side. Read: no bugs. Just plain html pages that you upload on any host. No account on a specific service either (like wordpress.com), which means no adds, no terms of use, no limitations of any kind.</p>

<p>Second advantage is in the long run. What will tumblr or about.me be in 10 years ? What is gonna happen when I need to transfer my site from wordpress.com to the new cool thing ? One thing is sure, plain html is gonna be here for a long time. This site is hosted on github, but if I want it on dropbox or any other host, I upload the file there and it is up in minutes, literally.</p>

<p>I decided to go for the superb Hyde theme. It is responsive (try resize that window) and it&rsquo;s mobile first/content first. It means you don&rsquo;t have one hundred links on the sidebar, you don&rsquo;t have the avatar of every single guy who likes the page on the facebook, no wordcloud, no widgets everywhere, etc. Deliver the content efficiently, else it&rsquo;s gonna be unreadable on a small smartphone screen. And it looks so clean on big one.</p>

<p>Light, fast, responsive, content first, customizable… I feel so free ! Going back to a CMS from Hugo for this kind of site would just feel like riding a limo on bike path.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do this for far too long, here it is: I have my own website !</p>

<p>So what to expect here ? First the usual hub: vita, publications, social links. Nothings you couldn&rsquo;t find on my lab&rsquo;s site or linkedin, but this can&rsquo;t be in too many places.</p>

<p>But a personal site should be, well, a bit more personal. So I listed here some resources, like templates and a few readings. The kind of things I would tell you if we were to meet in person, but you would never ask by e-mail. This section will grow in the near future, with some software advices and teaching resources.</p>

<p>Finally, I always wanted to have some sort of irregular blog on both city science and working in the academia. Half scientific things that doesn&rsquo;t really fit journals, comments on articles, discussion on research itself (read: surviving a PhD), productivity at work, etc. I want to write on all those topics and I think it&rsquo;s the ideal place to so.</p>

<p>Hopefully this site last in the long run, survives institutions and lab changes. I hope it gives you some useful infos and – who knows – maybe some fun. Enjoy your visit and feel free to share your feelings on this site !</p>
