			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 6, 2016</span>
			      <p>So it seems like Masdar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/16/masdars-zero-carbon-dream-could-become-worlds-first-green-ghost-town">is not going to be anywhere near net zero</a>. Not like it&rsquo;s much of a surprise to anybody. But the new figure of 50% brings back many questions, most of them old. How do you compute this number for a full city? Is Masdar going to be a city at all? Is it any good by the way?</p>

<p>Coming out with the embodied energy of a city is quite difficult, mainly because of the way you estimate the lifespan. A sustainable city lifespan is more or less infinite and if you are betting your city dies in 50 years, you better not build it. That wasn&rsquo;t much of a problem when the planned city was net zero: operative energy is fully clean and material are carbon neutral in a way or another. Divide zero by as long as you want, it&rsquo;s zero.</p>

<p>But now that they figured their material and construction are not carbon neutral—and I&rsquo;m not even counting countless flights of star architects and engineers bragging all over the world—how does the math works? What I guess, is that they account for embodied energy of buildings and roads and the operative energy (most likely negative) of the first cycle of buildings. So the first cycle of the built environment is net zero.</p>

<p>Now this is very problematic, because a few roads and rails sitting next to pretentious buildings are nowhere near to be a city. If you look at <a href="http://www.paris.fr/viewmultimediadocument?multimediadocument-id=31448">the carbon balance of Paris</a>, it accounts for all kinds of things: food, administration, imported goods, of course transportation, but also agriculture etc.</p>

<p>Which brings back to a well known point: Masdar is not a city anyways and is not going to be any time soon. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of empty buildings and infrastructure sitting next to each other. First life, then space, then buildings is a well known receipe for sustainable urban places. Well, it seems like first money, then buildings is good receipe for desert ghost town. The good part is, you don&rsquo;t need too much solar energy to run empty buildings. Or maybe you don&rsquo;t build them in the first place.</p>

<p>But whatever, I&rsquo;m just jealous. Masdar may not be as good as it was supposed to but any “pioneer” faces problems, right? And 50% ain&rsquo;t that bad, right? Well: wrong and… wrong. First, going 50% on just the built environment is nothing new. From Malmö to Frieburg, people were already doing this in the 90&rsquo;s and 00&rsquo;s. Today&rsquo;s ambitious standard are far higher and most likely far more inclusive.</p>

<p>Then 50% net energy is nothing to be ashamed of, but it&rsquo;s pretty standard for eco-districts nowadays. At AREP we are working on <a href="http://www.tracesecritesnews.fr/actualite/besancon-57219">Besançon-Viotte eco-district</a>. You never heard of it because it&rsquo;s no fancy flagship project, it&rsquo;s just a regular project, with regular budget constraints (and people doing good work). My lowest estimate for renewables on this oh-so-normal project is about 50% operative energy and my highest suggestion was about <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>% net energy. The better option was nothing near Masdar, just a tank storage with a low temperature heat network and local wood structural elements. Still, it&rsquo;s in the same league as Masdar in terms of energy efficiency and so are hundreds of other projects around the world. And in cities that are gonna get build for real, with people in it and everything, not desert ghost towns.</p>

<p>The conclusion then seems pretty simple: stop Masdar and send us your money. We&rsquo;ll happily build net zero districts!</p>
