      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanting to do this for far too long, here it is: I have my own website !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to expect here ? First the usual hub: vita, publications, social links. Nothings you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find on my lab&amp;rsquo;s site or linkedin, but this can&amp;rsquo;t be in too many places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a personnal site should be, well, a bit more personnal. So I listed here some ressources on how I work, diverses templates, tips and a few readings. The kind of things I would tell you if we were to meet in person, but you would never ask by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I always wanted to have some sort of irregular blog on both city science and working in the academia. Half scientific things that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit journals, comments on articles, discussion on reasearch itself (read: surviving a PhD), productivity at work, etc. I want to write on all those topics and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the ideal place to so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this site last in the long run, survives instutions and lab changes. I hope it gives you some useful infos and – who knows – maybe some fun. Enjoy your visit and feel free to share your feelings on this site !&lt;/p&gt;
