### [&rarr; My Résumé](/EtienneBurdet_CV.pdf)

I'm an urban engineer, currently doing smartcity R&D at [AREP](http://www.arepgroup.com/). My work is to help everybody about all thoses new connected things, should they be architect or electrical engineer, and make sure they make sense for an architectural project. Before that, I did research on the relation between energy fluxes and urban morphology at EIVP and CSTB. I also work on various side-topics regarding urban morphology, urban design/planning and urban climate.

Here is how I look in my natural habitat :

Beside work on cities, I traded my living room for movie theaters, I hunt art exhibitions, dance and new circus performances in Paris, I'm a huge tea/wine/food/restaurants geek and a passionate snowboarder.
