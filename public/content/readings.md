I realized that whenever I talk about my work, I end up giving a list of pretty standard books, rather than the latest new fancy thing in my feeds. They are not my daily read, neither my only reading topic. It is more a minimal list of the basics of my discipline. It should give you a good sense of where I'm from.

### If you had only one to read
- **[Cities and Forms: On Sustainable Urbanism](http://www.amazon.com/Cities-Forms-On-Sustainable-Urbanism/dp/2705681116/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414488270&sr=8-1&keywords=serge+salat)** : The big bad guy. I was in Serge's lab when he wrote this and he is kind of my mentor. I'm not sure it's readable straight from start to finish and I don't necessarily endorse all views. But the amount of information in this book is just incredible.

### Morphology
- **[The Urban Housing Handbook](http://www.amazon.fr/Urban-Housing-Handbook-Eric-Firley/dp/1119989981)** : before anything, look at what has been done in the world. Excellent maps and essential figures on density. Follow-up on towers and masterplanning are definitely worth reading too.
- **[Streets & Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Streets-Patterns-Stephen-Marshall/dp/0415317509)**: Once again a broad view, not super technical. Just make sure you have all those pictures in mind.
- **[Space Matrix](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Space-Matrix-Density-Urban-Form/dp/9056627422)** : Are you sure you know you basic arithmetics of urban morpho' ? Super simple, still essential for good problem setting.

### Urban Energy Modeling
- **[Computer Modeling For Sustainable Urban Design](http://www.amazon.fr/Computer-Modelling-Sustainable-Urban-Design/dp/1844076792)** : everything urban energy modeling, state of the art (the few newly published things doesn't really change the game).
- A few articles: **[Ratti 2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7788\(02\)00079-8)**, **[Ratti 2005](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778804003391)**, **[Robinson 2006](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038092X06000612)**, for passive volume, perimeter blocks and irregular irradiation patterns.

### Modeling Epistemology
- **[Théorie du Système Général - Théorie de la Modélisation](http://www.mcxapc.org/inserts/ouvrages/0609tsgtm.pdf)** : why are we even modeling ? This book is my base on systemic, on complex systems and more broadly on why I'm not modeling like a physicist.
- **[Economic Models as Analogy](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/ecoj.12128)**: a primer on case-based reasoning and analogy interpretation of models. Initially for economy, it works really well for city modeling too (found this one on James Keirstead's [website](http://www.jameskeirstead.ca/)).

Once again, remember that it is a very minimal list, nothing exhaustive. But it should get you started on the topic.
