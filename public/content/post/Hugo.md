Whether for a personal page or a project site, we need websites all the time, to be someone on the web. We want something simple, but we don't necessarily have the money to hire a pro (when we should) – but hey, this shouldn't be that hard. So what do we have ? A tumblr, wordpress.com ? Hosting your own wordpress or drupal ? WYSIWYG tools ?

For this web site, I chose a static generator: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Why ? You Input text files, it outputs a full – super lightweight and responsive – plain html site. Magic happens in the middle.
Be cool, be static

In those hipsterish days, old is the new cool and apparently we are back to static sites. Or static generator to be more precise.

So how does the thing works ? First I installed Hugo (it takes about 2 clicks) and told him *“new site please”*. He gave me an empty site that I used as a backbone. Now when I want to input a new page, or a new blog post, I write the content in a text file using markdown and… that's about it. Then you say *“hey Hugo, make a site out of this bunch of text files”* and he generates a whole site in milliseconds. A fully static, ready to upload website.

That simple ? That simple. You can customize the template, by digging a bit into the HTML/CSS/Go template. It is hackable to the core. The really great thing being the learning curve. Simple things — such as the social button — are simple to do and from there you can gradually tweak your site more and more.

First advantage: no database. No php, no CMS, no accounts, no nothing server side. Read: no bugs. Just plain html pages that you upload on any host. No account on a specific service either (like wordpress.com), which means no adds, no terms of use, no limitations of any kind.

Second advantage is in the long run. What will tumblr or about.me be in 10 years ? What is gonna happen when I need to transfer my site from wordpress.com to the new cool thing ? One thing is sure, plain html is gonna be here for a long time. This site is hosted on github, but if I want it on dropbox or any other host, I upload the file there and it is up in minutes, literally.

I decided to go for the superb Hyde theme. It is responsive (try resize that window) and it's mobile first/content first. It means you don't have one hundred links on the sidebar, you don't have the avatar of every single guy who likes the page on the facebook, no wordcloud, no widgets everywhere, etc. Deliver the content efficiently, else it's gonna be unreadable on a small smartphone screen. And it looks so clean on big one.

Light, fast, responsive, content first, customizable… I feel so free ! Going back to a CMS from Hugo for this kind of site would just feel like riding a limo on bike path.
