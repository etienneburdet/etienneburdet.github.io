Source code and (public) content of my personnal website etienneburdet.com . The site is built with lovely [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

The core site is open source (see licence), but the content is mine. I don't see any reason to fork from this repo though. You should consider starting with hugo and hyde theme, and maybe copy a few lines of code !
